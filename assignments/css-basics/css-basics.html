                <h3>Cactus</h3>
                <p>I will be dedicating this website to my ever so growing (no pun intended) passion for plants. One of my favorite plants is a cactus, cactuses are very cool looking. Despite their pointy spikes they are very beautiful. </p>

                <h3>Aloe Vera</h3>
                <p>Another type of plant I find interesting is an aloe vera plant. My mom always had several of these around our house, so I grew very fond of them. I also like how they have medicinal purposes. </p>

                <h3>Section 3</h3>
                <h3>Snake Plant</h3>
                <p>The last plant I will be talking about is a snake plant. These types of plants are found in office spaces mainly because of their elegance and beauty. I like their overall patterns and colorations. </p>
